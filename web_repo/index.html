  <h3>About me: <h3>
  <h4><em>I am from Los Gatos, California. My major is Creative Technology and Design. One day, I hope to work in product design. I feel as though regardless of my preferred career path, it is always helpful to understand coding and modern technology because of how heavily our society relies on computers.</em></h4>
