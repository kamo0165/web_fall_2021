    <p>Icelandic horses are the breed of horse native to Iceland. They have very long hair and tend to be slightly smaller than that of a regular horse. They have four to five gaits, including walk, trot, canter, t√∂lt, and pace. In competition, the horses are judged on their performance of the gaits and harmony with the rider. In addition, five gaited horses can compete in pace races.</p>

    <p>Once a horse leaves Iceland, it may never go back. This ensures that Icelandic horses are one of the most pure breeds. It also prevents them from diease and endangerment. When the horses have to travel outside of the country for world competitions, the riders then have to sell their horse there because they cannot bring the horse back with them to Iceland.</p>
